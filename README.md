Explanation
This code will make two LEDs blink alternately. One LED is connected to pin 3, and the other is connected to pin 4. The code will turn one LED on while turning the other off, then switch after a delay, creating a blinking effect.

Components Needed
Arduino board
2 LEDs
2 resistors (220Î© recommended)
Jumper wires
Breadboard
Connections
Connect the positive leg (anode) of the first LED to pin 3 through a resistor.
Connect the negative leg (cathode) of the first LED to the ground.
Connect the positive leg (anode) of the second LED to pin 4 through a resistor.
Connect the negative leg (cathode) of the second LED to the ground.
You can copy this code into the Arduino IDE and upload it to your Arduino board. This will make the LEDs connected to pin 3 and pin 4 blink alternately every 500 milliseconds.
